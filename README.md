## Game Theory

Game theory studies the interactions of the players involved in order to choose optimal decisions for each player, according to their particular interests, or not, is widely used in the economic field, among others.

## Colonel Blotto

It is based on a two player game, the player and his opponent, Colonel Blotto, where the two divide their troops between the battlefields in order to lead that field, and thus, getting more leaderships, beat the game. The division of troops is hidden to player.
